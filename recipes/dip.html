            <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a copycat of Chuy's famous Jalapeno Ranch dip. The 
    popular Tex-Mex chain boasts several location across the United States.
I have been making this dip for parties and various get-togethers, to 
the extreme delight of friends and family. I often get asked for the recipe,
so thought I would just make a page outlining the ingredients.</p> 
<p>The recipe is extremely simple, and comes together in mere minutes.
    There are only a handful of ingredients, and once made this dip goes well
    with absolutely anything. Just use your imagination! I've heard
    friends dip anything from tortilla chips, to Cheez-Its, to 
    various veggies in it.</p></body>
