    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Who doesn't love grilled cheese? The two ingredients 
    (bread and cheese) are two of the most delicious things ever.
    Of course, a little butter never hurt either. 
    <p>I enjoy fancy grilled cheese as much as the n ext person,
        but am also a big fan of the classic white bread with 
        American cheese. This recipe is easy as can be.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li>2 slices of white or what bread</li>
        <li>1 slice of American cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li></ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol><li>Melt half the tablespoon of butter in a medium
        pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add one slice of bread and top with cheese slice and 
        other bread slice.</li>
    <li>Once bread has been toasted to you liking,
        add the other half of the butter, and flip sandwich 
        to toast the other side.</li>
    <li>Serve sandwich whole or cut in half. Tomato soup 
        optional!</li></ol>
